This script for RG351 devices allows you to change the system time and date while offline. Your device MUST NOT be connected to the internet for the time and date changes to stay because the time is automatically corrected when connected to the internet.

PortMaster installed on your device is required for this script to work. Follow the PortMaster installation instructions here:

https://github.com/christianhaitian/PortMaster

After PortMaster is installed save ChangeTime.sh to your "ports" folder and run the script. For those unfamiliar with Github, click on the green "Code" button and select "Download Zip".

If everything is setup correctly then you should get a blue screen with a "Change Time", "Change Date", and "Exit" menu.
